📌 Project Title
Guarding Transactions with AI-powered Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention

📖 Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the security of financial transactions through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for detecting and preventing credit card fraud. By analyzing transaction patterns and utilizing machine learning models, our system can identify potentially fraudulent activities in real-time and alert users or financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of financial loss. The solution leverages supervised learning algorithms on real-world datasets to ensure accurate and efficient fraud detection.
